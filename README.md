- [Open-closed principle(OCP)](https://github.com/Andrey-Valciuc/clean_code/tree/main/principles/SOLID/OpenClosed)
- [Liskov substitution principle(LSP)](https://github.com/Andrey-Valciuc/clean_code/tree/main/principles/SOLID/LiskovSubstitution)
- [Interface segregation principle(ISP)](https://github.com/Andrey-Valciuc/clean_code/tree/main/principles/SOLID/InterfaceSegregation)
- [Dependency inversion principle(DIP)](https://github.com/Andrey-Valciuc/clean_code/tree/main/principles/SOLID/DependencyInversion)
