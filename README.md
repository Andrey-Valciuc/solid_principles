- [Single responsibility principle(SRP)](https://github.com/Andrey-Valciuc/solid_principles/tree/main/solid/SingleResponsibility)
- [Open-closed principle(OCP)](https://github.com/Andrey-Valciuc/solid_principles/tree/main/solid/OpenClosed)
- [Liskov substitution principle(LSP)](https://github.com/Andrey-Valciuc/solid_principles/tree/main/solid/LiskovSubstitution)
- [Interface segregation principle(ISP)](https://github.com/Andrey-Valciuc/solid_principles/tree/main/solid/InterfaceSegregation)
- [Dependency inversion principle(DIP)](https://github.com/Andrey-Valciuc/solid_principles/tree/main/solid/DependencyInversion)
